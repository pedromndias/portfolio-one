## Overview
This is my portfolio’s website, which I made from scratch using just HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript, without the help of any libraries. It has some of the projects I made and also a blog about my coding journey.

## Features
- Divided into sections, we can navigate to each one of them through a menu on the top. When the browser window’s width is under 870px, the menu will collapse into a “burger menu”.
- In the project section, the image of each project is also a link to a separate page with more details and screenshots about it.
- The website is fully responsive and the content will adapt to different screen sizes. It was built using a “mobile first” workflow.
- The blog page includes the entries of a coding log that I have been writing, where the top entries are the most recent ones.
- From every page, there is a link to go back to the homepage or to the contact section.
