                <p>
                    I am so excited to have finished the Bootcamp!! What an incredible journey.. The last week was super intense as we had to build the third and final project, a full-stack MERN application, using React and all the technologies we have learned during the course. I built a productivity app and it was voted to represent this bootcamp in the Hackshow, Ironhack's prestigious event to celebrate all the finalists from each course. Here’s a glimpse:

                    I never thought I would learn so much and I am very grateful to our teacher Jorge, which is an amazing person and is very dedicated to teaching us all these languages and preparing us for what’s next. I have learned a lot and would definitely recommend this experience to anyone trying to make a career change. Here's a screenshot of my certificate:

                    Next week starts the CareerHack, the follow-up by a specialized team that will help us find our first job. I am very excited about that! I have been updating my portfolio, LinkedIn profile and CV, hoping that they will help me improve them and finally start applying to Web Development jobs!

                <p>
                    I just finished Module 2 and the course has been incredible! It is way more intense than I expected, the labs (homework) are difficult and usually we have to stay a couple of hours after class to complete them. After each module, there is a big project that we have to build and present. The first project was a game using JavaScript canvas and classes. My project was a motorcycle game where the rider needs to avoid traffic and roadblocks. It has two levels and it is super entertaining. It was a lot of fun to build! Here’s a screenshot:
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second project was made with another student. This was very important since we got to train some Pair Programming and use Git and Github as a team, something that I have never done before. We built a full-stack application using a live Database and Models to store the data. We also used routes to navigate through the different pages which are rendered using Handlebars, a JavaScript library that I have never used before:

                    So far I feel great about my decision to start this course. I thought it would be mostly reviewing the concepts I already knew but I am learning a lot, the content is super updated and the teacher Jorge is very kind and patient.

                <p>
                    After a lot of thinking I decided that I would give Ironhack a go. If becoming a Web Developer is what I want, then I believe that their course will help me achieve that. I need that discipline of having classes every day from 9 am to 6 pm, with a teacher giving lectures and homework night, building projects, presenting them, etc.

                    I start the 9-week course on the 10th of April and right now I am doing Module 0, which is a week of preparation to get ready for the intensive weeks. It consists of learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is online through Zoom conference and there are a lot of students. Here’s a picture of the first day:

                <p>
                    There’s a programming school here in Barcelona that I’ve heard truly nice things of. It is called Ironhack and they have Web Development, UX/UI, Cybersecurity and Data Analyst intensive Bootcamps. They are expensive but I know people that completed them and say it is worth it. The content is very complete and updated and there are lots of labs and projects to train and start building up a portfolio. A teacher and an assistant would assist during the 9 weeks and if we complete it then there will be a follow-up by a career team, which will help the students find the first job. I decided to attend an open day at the school to clarify my doubts about the course and I enjoyed it a lot. Here’s a picture of the school:

                <p>
                    New year.. more opportunities! I took more Barcelona Activa courses, as I really enjoyed the previous experience with the React one. It is nice to have someone physically teaching in a classroom, and not just watching pre-recorded videos. This time I attended courses on Email Marketing, Trello with Agile Methodologies and Cybersecurity:

                <p>
                    Every time I check Web Development job offers I see that more and more companies ask for TypeScript as a skill. This way, I continued the course that I had bought on Udemy and I find it really interesting. Although TypeScript is a bit too restrictive compared to JavaScript I guess that’s the point, security when writing code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I also have some extra time, I continue with the CS50 course, trying to complete it before the end of the year so I don’t have to repeat some of the exercises. The content is very difficult but very important to get a general knowledge about Computer Science.

                    As part of the municipal plan for technological development in Barcelona, there are several training centers that offer free courses in different IT areas. Here is a photo of the hall of one of these centers:

                    From many courses regarding coding, a lot were entry-level. I decided to attend the 3 days React for Beginners one. Even though I have good knowledge of React, I wanted to review some of its features and it would be the first time I have live coding training, as so far I have been doing all my learning online. It was in Catalan and the teacher was really helpful, as well as all the material available and installations. I will definitely try to attend more courses, even in other areas like Marketing.

                <p>
                    I didn’t have much time at the end of summer, but I managed to organize myself and check the situation on the CS50 course from Harvard, which I want to complete before the end of the year. As some of the progress migrated from 2021 to 2022’s version of the course, the modules I did before had to be redone. It was interesting to redo some of the early projects and finish some of the new labs. Now the remaining work is to watch lessons 9 and 10 and the final project, which I will try to finish by the end of this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On LinkedIn, I found the possibility to do some free small courses in the Learning section, which are quick courses available for 24 hours (if not on the Premium). I did 2 on React and they were very complete.

                    I got my certificate!! It’s been some very intense months and I followed my coding schedule and after a lot of struggle with Advanced React I finally completed that module. The following module was interview preparation and then I got the email with my course certificate. Although I have to review a lot of concepts and keep learning, this was a big achievement and I am very happy about it:

                    I am now completing some extra exercises on React as it has a lot of difficult concepts and requires that I keep practicing it. For the next steps, I think I will start coding my project portfolio. I asked around and there’s this website called Netlify that connects to Github and can publish our code online for free. I am also learning Typescript on Scrimba. There’s a course about it and I started it because more and more companies use this technology. I have been looking into LinkedIn lately to check what’s on demand these days.

                <p>
                    A good part of the Frontend Developer Career Path is about React. Starting to learn this JavaScript library is a great milestone on my coding journey. This is completely on another level of programming and before starting this module I took some extra lessons at the Scrimba academy to review some ES6 fundamentals, so I am extra prepared to learn React basics (which is not easy):

                <p>
                    As solo projects we built simple pages using React, like this basic travel journal:

                <p>
                    Apart from this, I enjoyed the previous module where we were taught the basics of a good UI/UX design. I am also using the MIMO coding app daily again, doing some article reading on the FreeCodeCamp website and participating weekly in the Scrimba Discord community. That Discord channel is great to clear some doubts on our code and reading about how people got hired after Scrimba. It’s also nice to help fellow students, as trying to explain a concept is also a way of learning…

                    So far my coding schedule is going great. I have been able to code about 5 days per week. I started the Frontend Developer Career Path all over again and it’s good to review all the basic topics.

                <p>
                    The refactoring of the course is fantastic and they introduced a lot of solo projects like a Color Scheme Generator or a Film Finder using a real API!

                    Regarding CSS I finally entered the world of Grid Layout. It’s strange to code it at first but can make our life easier in some cases, where using “Display: Flex” would be a lot of extra work:

                <p>
                    Due to some personal situations, I was not able to code a lot during the past months. I have a job that I took some months ago to have time to focus on my studies. But the truth is that after spending 8 hours a day working on a computer it is not easy to learn how to code for a few more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided I need to organize a weekly schedule and make sure I follow those hours, otherwise, I will never get to my goal: become a Frontend Web Developer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent several days reviewing the code and projects I did until now and I have come to a decision: I need to go back to basics. Coding requires daily practice and 2 months without coding has left me very rusty on the concepts… Scrimba’s Frontend Path has some lesson refactors and I will start it from the beginning. This way I can review the fundamentals and prepare for the more advanced concepts.

Users can register and log in to view all the campgrounds or to create one. Campgrounds are shown on a real-world map and by clicking on one it will show all the info about it. Editing and deleting are also possible by the creator of the campground.

                    This was my first contact with a lot of technologies like validation (ExpressError and JOI), databases and models (MongoDB), sessions and cookies (Express Session), messages (Flash), authentication and authorization (Passport), files/image upload (Multer and Cloudinary), geocoding and maps (GeoJSON and Mapbox), security issues (Sanitize packages and Helmet) and deploying (MongoDB Atlas and Heroku). Most of all, I really enjoyed working with routing on Express.js and Node.js.

                    After two weeks without coding, I continued with the CS50 Course on EDX. The weekly Problem Sets are always super difficult. They require a lot of dedication but it feels awesome when I complete them. But most important is not to stress and go back to basics and review some simple JavaScript:

                    New year, new life… Well for me is a “new platform”. Apart from continuing with the Udemy course, now I am a lot of time on the Scrimba platform. I started the Frontend Developer Career Path and it has tons of amazing videos, tutorials, exercises and solo projects. They also do live coding every week on Youtube and I am permanently connected to their discord channel, as it has very important updates. The community is also great and helpful. So far it is being an awesome experience!

                    In some of the lessons at FreeCodeCamp, they use this interesting technology where we can stop the teacher’s video and edit their code. Sometimes that is how we do the exercise, incredible! That feature is from Scrimba, a coding platform that has many courses and collaborates with FreeCodeCamp. I have registered on their website and some days ago I got an email saying they have 74% off on the annual subscription fee and that they have launched a course called “The Frontend Developer Career Path”. I took the opportunity and bought it. I think that together with the Udemy and Harvard courses this will help me achieve my goal of becoming a Web Developer.

                <p>
                    The small desktop computer I bought a year ago is getting very slow and crashing sometimes. I guess it is not powerful enough to handle running a lot of stuff at the same time. I bought something more powerful, with a lot more RAM. It’s still not super great as it has an integrated graphic card, but it can handle a second monitor if I want.

                    Also, I haven’t been able to code a lot during the summer and Colt Steele just refactored the Web Dev Bootcamp so it uses the new features from ES6. With this, I decided to restart the course from the beginning. This is a way to go over some of the basic concepts and update with the new features. I also find it very motivating to start again...

There are tons of exercises and I can practice a lot of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here are some screenshots of one exercise that we coded in the course, where we randomly generate a color and then we have to guess it based on the RGB values given:

                    By recommendation of the academy, I bought the Eloquent JavaScript book. It is the 3rd edition (2018) so it already includes the ES6 JavaScript update. I find it a bit difficult in terms of the language used but I guess that all programming books are like these. Anyway I am learning and going over some concepts that I already forgot. I hope this book will help me master JavaScript someday!

                <p>
                    Following learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the next course at the academy is the one about Solidity language. This is the language in which the Ethereum blockchain is coded and it is based on JavaScript. I managed to fastly do the first course as it was just an introduction to the language. It was fun to start coding some smart contracts. It required installing a lot of additional programs, as we need to simulate a blockchain. The only difficulty with the first course was setting up all the coding environments. I wrote it all on a whiteboard:

                    Early this month, a pandemic was declared and everything was shut down, due to the Coronavirus that is going around everywhere. As I have to stay home every day, I have more time to study and I started the second course of the Ethereum Smart Contract Programming series. This one is very hard and requires us to build a solo working project. The teacher gives some initial orientation but then it is all on us. I understand that in the real world this is more or less how it works but coding a dapp and smart contract by myself is very difficult. I consulted some tutors at the academy and they gave me extra help. The project consisted of building a dapp that connects to our wallet and we can try to double some amount of ETH that we decide to bet. It then randomly gives either double ETH to the player or gets the ETH from the player. This is a screenshot of the frontend:

                <p>
                    The tutor that was helping me liked the frontend design but told me that the Solidity code had a lot to improve to get the dapp running. I struggled a lot of days with writing the code and then I realized that I lacked some JavaScript fundamentals. With this situation, I decided to pause that course for a little bit and focus on mastering JavaScript.

                    In January I found a promotion on the Udemy platform and bought a Wed Development course. I think it is time that I go back to basics and start this course. It will give me more practice with JavaScript and then I can be ready to continue with Solidity programming.

                    I discovered a platform with a lot of courses from worldwide universities and most of them we can attend for free. That’s EDX and one course that got my attention was Harvard’s CS50, Introduction to Computer Science. It is taught by Professor David Malan and it is amazing. It’s an entry-level course and is very well done. The teacher explains everything very well and he really knows how to keep our attention and motivation. At the end of each lecture, there is a Problem Set that is very very difficult. It is consuming some time but this knowledge helps me understand the essence of computer science and not just coding in general.
